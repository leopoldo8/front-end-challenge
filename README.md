# Navedex

This project is a front-end challenge built with React, Context API, Styled-components, Prop-types and atomic design structured.

The Navedex lists Navers, showing a little bit about themselves.

You may add new Navers, as well as edit or delete them.

There is also an authentication system, to protect these actions to signed users.
